# SPOT | the parking app

Would you like me to find you a parking SPOT? SPOT is a mySQL/Laravel/Vue based app that allows users to interact with our parking garage. They can get a ticket, pay their ticket, see how much parking is available and if the lot is full then queue up for the next available spot.

## Built With

* mySQL
* Laravel
* Vue.js

## Seeded Database

The database makes use of laravel seeder to populate all the fields with dummy data for you to better visualize how a user might navigate through the experience. A mysql file has also been provided for you, should you wish to see the database structure that way.
