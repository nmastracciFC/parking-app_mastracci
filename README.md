# parking-app_mastracci

Hello! Would you like me to find you a parking SPOT? SPOT is a mySQL/Laravel/Vue based app that allows users to interact with their parking garage. They can get a ticket, pay their ticket, see how much parking is available and if the lot is full then queue up for the next available spot.


Here's how you can get started.
